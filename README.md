# Advent of Code
This repository is for hosting my advent of code solutions. Anyone may view my solutions to the problems, but do not (intentionally) copy the code. The whole point of the challenge is to learn challenge yourself, and maybe learn something.

The order of the code is going to be `<year>/<language>/` with all of the code for each day going to differ, depending on the language.

Best of luck, and I hope you are able to figure out everything!
